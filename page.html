        <b>SUMMARY:</b><br>
        In conclude we say, Business Process Management (BPM) is a management approach or technique that involves using various methods, and tools to improve how businesses operate. Over the years, BPM has developed and expanded, encompassing several key themes.
        One of the main themes in BPM is the development of BPM systems, which are software systems that support the design and execution of business processes. These systems help organizations manage their processes more effectively and efficiently.
        Process modeling is another important aspect of BPM. It involves creating visual representations of business processes, such as flowcharts, to understand how tasks and activities are performed. Process models serve as a blueprint for designing and improving processes.
        Process design focuses on designing and optimizing business processes to achieve specific goals, such as reducing costs or improving customer satisfaction. It involves analyzing existing processes, identifying areas for improvement, and implementing changes.
        Coordination and interoperability are key considerations in BPM, as they involve ensuring smooth collaboration and information exchange between different systems, departments, and stakeholders involved in the processes.
        Model management involves managing the lifecycle of process models, including version control, documentation, and maintenance. It ensures that process models remain up to date and relevant.

        Process mining is a relatively new field within BPM that uses data from operational systems to discover, analyze, and improve business processes. It provides insights into how processes are actually executed, allowing organizations to identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and improvement opportunities.
        Lastly, new technologies play a significant role in BPM. Advances in areas like artificial intelligence, automation, and robotics offer opportunities to streamline processes and enhance decision-making.
        Overall, these themes represent the evolution of the BPM discipline, demonstrating its dynamic nature and its continuous efforts to improve organizational processes and achieve better business outcomes.
